# AI Code Snippets

## Overview
Welcome to the **AI-Code-Snippets** repository! This project is a collection of small, focused code snippets and mini-projects designed to help beginners and enthusiasts explore key concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Whether you're experimenting with basic algorithms or trying out new techniques, this repository provides a starting point for learning and practical coding in AI.

## Repository Structure
- **`snippets/`**: Contains small, well-organized code snippets demonstrating specific AI/ML concepts.
- **`mini-projects/`**: Includes simple projects that apply AI/ML algorithms to real-world problems.
- **`resources/`**: A curated list of tutorials, articles, and documentation that have helped in learning AI and machine learning.

## Getting Started
To use or explore the code in this repository, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Code-Snippets.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Snippet or Project
